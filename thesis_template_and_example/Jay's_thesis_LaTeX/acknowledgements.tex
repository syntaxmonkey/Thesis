I would like to show my greatest gratitude to my mentor, supervisor and friend, Dr. David Mould. I have been extremely blessed to have your guidance, your encouragement, your advice and your patience. You are so intelligent, resourceful, knowledgeable and kind. I cannot hope to have anyone better to be my supervisor. God bless you!

I would like to thank the thesis committee for reviewing my work and giving me those valuable suggestions. I must also express my appreciation to my colleagues and friends in GIGL lab and the School of Computer Science. Their brilliance has encouraged me to aim higher and work harder. 

I would like to thank GRAND, NSERC, Carleton University and GIGL lab for their persistent financial support.
